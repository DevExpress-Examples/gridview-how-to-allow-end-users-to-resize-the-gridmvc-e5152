# GridView - How to allow end-users to resize the grid(MVC)


<p>This example is an implementation of the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E5057">E5057: ASPxGridView - How to allow end-users to resize the grid</a> example for the MVC platform. <br />
The example supports both postponed (when the control's frame is rendered and resized on a mouse move, and the control is actually resized after the mouse button is released) and real time resizing (when the control is resized on mouse move). Set the 'postpone' JavaScript variable to 'false', to allow real time resizing.</p>
